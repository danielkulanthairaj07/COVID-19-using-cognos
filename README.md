# DAC_PHASE PROJECT SUBMISSION
# COVID-19 Cases Analysis
This repository contains code and resources for analyzing COVID-19 cases data. The Aim is to provide insights and visualizations regarding the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
# DataSet: 
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/covid-19-cases

To run the code, we need the following dependencies:
# Pre-requisites 
          Python 3.6 or higher
          Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebooks)
          Pandas
          Matplotlib
          NumPy
          Seaborn
          Plotly (optional, for interactive visualizations)
# Installation
You can install the required Python packages using pip.
For example:
  pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn plotly

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/danielkulanthairaj07/COVID-19-using-cognos/edit/main/README.md

# Running the Analysis
   **Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the Prerequisites section**
      Launch a Jupyter Notebook (if you have it installed): 
      jupyter notebook
      Open the Jupyter Notebook file provided in the repository (e.g., covid19_analysis.ipynb) in your browser.
      Run the cells in the notebook one by one to perform the analysis. You can also run the analysis scripts directly if you prefer not to use Jupyter Notebook.
      Follow the instructions and comments in the code for guidance on how to customize and extend the analysis.

## Conclusion

 **Global Impact:** We have visualized the global spread of COVID-19, tracking confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time. This has provided insights into the scale of the pandemic.

 **Regional Insights:** Our analysis has delved into regional trends, helping us understand how different areas have been affected and how the situation has evolved over time.

 **Trend Analysis:** We have examined the trends and patterns of the virus, identifying peak periods and the effectiveness of interventions like lockdowns and vaccination campaigns.

 **Data Visualization:** Through a combination of static and interactive visualizations, we have made the data more accessible, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pandemic's progression.

 **Future Work:** This analysis is a starting point. The insights gained can be used to inform public health decisions, resource allocation, and future research on COVID-19.

      Thank you for your interest in our COVID-19 cases analysis project.
